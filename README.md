# EDA-and-Visualization-HR-Attrition-Report
We performed Exploratory Data Analysis and did some cool visualizations to study the reasons for attrition in a given company.

# Summary

The aim of this report is to find the reasons why people leave the company. The data provided is across 10 departments of the company and has recorded 24% employees who left the company. It was observed from the data analysis that the low income is consistently driving the attrition irrespective of other factors like department, satisfaction level, etc.. Only certain departments like HR, accounting and Technical saw a high attrition even for medium income groups. Too much work on the one hand and too less work on the other extreme, both cause employees to leave the company. In terms of the satisfaction level and the workload of the employees, there were three clusters observed with high attrition. First cluster has a lower satisfaction level and high working hours. They seem to be overburdened with work. Cluster 2 is opposite of cluster 1 with employees with low working hours and moderate satisfaction. They are employees who are not satisfied with the amount of work/learning in the company. Cluster 3 has employees with high satisfaction and moderate working hours but low salaries. Salary seems to be the reason that employees in this cluster attrite.
